# TODO
------

- OK loop logic
- store current lines in an array (do the slicing job once & calculate the max text width then)
- loop back with shift space
- NO font size w.r.t. word length & sketch size
- â†“ handle case with upper line continuation after the start of the next line
- single font size based on display size, scrolling with stops at transitions!
- transition animations?
- interactivity/user input?
- zoom with two touches?
