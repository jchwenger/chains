# TODO
------

- OK loop logic
- OK store current lines in an array (do the slicing job once & calculate the max text width then)
- NO font size w.r.t. word length & sketch size
- OK â†“ handle case with upper line continuation after the start of the next line
- OK transition animations?
- OK interactivity/user input?
- NO zoom with two touches?
- OK two languages
- OK dedications?
- OK title when reading
- OK scrolling details for language lists
- OK chain titles, esp. lack of apostrophes in French
- NO single font size based on display size, scrolling with stops at transitions!

- better monospace simulation
- random choice (& animation?)
- 'independent' mode (reading happens without human intervention?)
- better transitions (! especially with long links, make sure there is always a window where only the current link is visible)
- triple check that all chains are ok & that verticalShift bug is gone
- better interaction when on desktop (using space/shift+space?)
